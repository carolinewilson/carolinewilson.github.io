Challenging the everyday use of plastic and supporting the Marine Conservation Society.

{% include gallery caption="Team Status Row take on the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge" %}


Setting out from the Canary Islands, the team rowed 3,192 miles non-stop for 61 days, 8 hours and 47 minutes, overcoming physical and mental battles to reach their finish line in Antigua. Our aim was to bridge the gap between awareness and action when it comes to plastic pollution and spread the word to refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle.

The team raised significant funds to support the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) - the UKâ€™s leading charity for the protection of our seas, shores and wildlife - and who is spearheading the fight against plastic pollution in the UK.

Each year, at least 8 million tonnes of plastics leak into the ocean- that's the equivalent of 6,341 plastic bottles every second. Once in the ocean, plastic breaks down and ingested by fish and marine mammals, killing them and entering our food chain and tap water.
