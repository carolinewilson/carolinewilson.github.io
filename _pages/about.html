<p>Ambitious and driven, in December 2018 I embarked upon the greatest challenge of my life; rowing 3000 miles across the Atlantic to challenge the everyday use of plastic as part of team Status Row.</p>

<p>After returning to the UK in February 2019 I took on a new challenge to manage the 3 month Kik-Plastic tour (7000km cycle participating in daily beach cleans with local communities) further raising awareness of the plastic pollution crisis and activating communities along the way.</p>

<p>Always looking for the next challenge, I'm passionate, determined and highly motivated to drive change for the better. Working with great teams to solve real-life problems, and creating a few along the way.</p>
