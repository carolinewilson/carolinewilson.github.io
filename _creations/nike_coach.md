If you’ve never been for a run, it’s hard to know where to begin or how to get motivated. As for finding the right shoes, it can be easy to get lost in the technical terminology.

So Nike asked us to create a voice and messaging experience that gives new runners all the answers they’re looking for.

Nike Coach helps people work towards their own health and fitness goals. It’s an easy-going and non-judgemental training experience that reminds us that even the most professional of Nike athletes were beginners once too.

With a few quick questions Nike Coach generates a tailored running plan that includes warm-ups and cool-downs, the latest Nike innovations, and tips on how to run farther and faster. Plus, users can change their goal or snooze their plan whenever they see fit.
